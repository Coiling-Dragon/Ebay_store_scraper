# Ebay_store_scraper
One of my first Python projects (year 2019). It was scraping multiple ebay stores and over 500 000 items (by UPC codes), for lowest price, changes and in/out of stock. The program had algorithms that were using selenium to update CSV files in Amazon seller central and BQool repricer, later done through APIs.
